# Space XPlorer

Our project, Space XPlorer, is an innovative app allowing users to track space events such as eclipses, rocket launches, asteroids or other Near Earth Objects and more. Space XPlorer is for those who are interested in or want to learn more about space. It allows users to experience and learn more about various celestial events. 


Users can view a map and see celestial events occurring in their area, as well as follow specific events and get notifications about when and where they are happening to ensure they do not miss them. They also have access to a Discover page where users can search for events occurring within a certain distance of their location. Users can also build a community by commenting on, liking or disliking such events. Additionally, users can view a newsfeed of articles related to the events they are interested in.
